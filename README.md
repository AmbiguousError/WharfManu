# WharfManu

**WharfManu** is a simple and fun diving game where the goal is to perform the best "manu" off the wharf! You'll be judged on your entry into the water – aim for the smallest splash. Somersaults will also impress the judges!

## How to Play

Download https://github.com/AmbiguousError/WharfManu/blob/main/dist/WharfManu.exe
The game is all about timing your jump and controlling your diver in the air.

### Controls:

* **Space Bar:**
    * Press once when the diver is on the platform to start the jump timing bar.
    * Press again to jump. The accuracy of this press determines your jump power.
    * Press to advance to the next dive or restart the competition after it ends.
* **Left/Right Arrow Keys:** Control the diver's rotation (somersaults) while in the air.
* **Up/Down Arrow Keys:** Control the diver's pike or tuck position while in the air.

### Gameplay:

1.  **Starting the Jump:** When your diver is on the wharf, press the **SPACE BAR** to activate the jump timing bar.
2.  **Jumping:** A marker will move along the timing bar. Press **SPACE BAR** again to make the diver jump.
    * Hitting the **green zone** gives you maximum jump power.
    * Hitting the **yellow zone** gives you a good jump.
    * Missing these zones results in a weaker jump.
3.  **Diving:**
    * Once in the air, use the **LEFT and RIGHT ARROW KEYS** to make your diver rotate and perform somersaults.
    * Use the **UP and DOWN ARROW KEYS** to adjust your diver's pike (how much they are bent at the hips).
4.  **Entry:** The angle and form of your diver as they enter the water determine your score. A clean, vertical entry with minimal splash (a small "entry width") is best.
5.  **Scoring:**
    * You get scores from 5 judges for each dive. The highest and lowest scores are dropped, and the remaining three are summed up.
    * The main factor for your score is the "entry width" – a smaller width (less splash) means a higher score.
    * The number of somersaults completed is also displayed.
6.  **Competition:**
    * You have 3 attempts per competition.
    * Your total score for the competition is the sum of your scores from the 3 dives.
    * After the competition, your total score will be displayed, and you'll see if you made it onto the high scores list!
